<p>I was lucky enought to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things<br>
while we were there!</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>On our first day, we started by visiting <i>Montmartre</i> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that<br>
beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <i>la Seine</i>.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
	<p>On our second day, we went shopping on <i>Avenue des Champs Elysees</i>. Every single person we saw was dressed in te height<br>
of fashion.</p>
<p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <i>Notre Dame.</i> We went on a macaron tour of<br>
Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <i>le Louvre.</i></p>

	<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>The picture is of me visiting the <i>Arce de Triomphe.</i> It's huge! We also went to <i>le Musee D'Orsay.</i> Seeing the work of<br>
Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many<br>
sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
